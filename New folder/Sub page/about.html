    <p class="parallax_description">Overview
Vianney is a private, all-boys, Catholic college preparatory high school serving grades nine through 12.
Our current enrollment is 585, representing 70 ZIP codes and Graduation`50 grade schools and parishes. Vianney draws students from across St. Louis city and county, from Jefferson and Franklin counties, and from the Metro East.
We have a student/teacher ratio of 13-to-1.
Tuition for the 2019-2020 school year is $15,400. This includes everything except for textbooks.
More than 60 percent of students receive some form of tuition assistance.
Christian service is integral to the Vianney experience. Service opportunities abound, and all students log at least 100 service hours during their time with us.
Vianney is conveniently located in Kirkwood at the intersection of Highway 44 and Lindbergh Boulevard.
Recent expansion provides additional classrooms, a media center, field house, student commons, bookstore, turfed stadium, STEM labs, a new turfed baseball/athletic complex and more.
Vianney is sponsored by the Society of Mary, an international religious order of priests and brothers known as Marianists.
Academics
The Class of 2019 earned a total of $16,247,453 in college scholarships.
Students take four courses per semester and graduate with 32 credits, among the highest in the Midwest.
About half of Vianney juniors and seniors earn college credits offered through Saint Louis University and the University of Missouri - St. Louis. 
About 95 percent of Vianney graduates complete four or more math courses and three or more science courses.
Vianney has a wireless campus and a "teacher-deployed technology plan," which emphasizes use of technology as a tool in educating the entire person. Laptops are readily available, with one computer for every two students.
About 99 percent of Vianney seniors go on to college, with about half of them receiving scholarship offers.
Our college-style, two-semester schedule
Vianney uses a schedule that closely resembles a typical collegiate schedule. Learning within the block is a shift in the methodology of education. In our schedule, a student takes more control of his education by being actively involved in the learning process. The environment fosters better interpersonal relationships, heightened critical thinking and stronger problem-solving skills, and allows students time for reflection. The schedule is designed to reduce some of the obstacles that interfere with student achievement, such as insufficient time for in-depth thought, high stress levels, and fragmented instruction.


Key Features:

Four 85-minute academic periods provide time for in-depth focus and exploration.
One 30-minute daily "encore" period provides students time to seek extra help, work ahead, participate in a co-curricular activity or or attend a communion service.
Teachers can give more personal attention to each student, because they have fewer students each semester.
Extended class time enables teachers the opportunity to develop lessons that offer more variety and in-depth thought.
Students take eight courses per year (four per semester) and graduate with 32 credits, among the highest in the Midwest.
The 32-credit requirement means that provides the opportunity to include an array of Advanced Placement (AP), Advanced College Credit (ACC) and Honors courses in the student's schedule.
As part of a college preparatory school, this schedule is better suited to a college and university format.
By using a college-style semester format, students complete full core credits in one semester. Therefore, students wishing to excel academically can fit up to 5 or 6 years of a given core subject into four years of school.
Class periods are long enough to allow for quality learning experiences that are less likely to occur in a shortened period. Activities are usually alternated within a class period for variety:

Debates
Student presentations
In-depth laboratory experiments
Concentrated writing projects
Practice time for difficult concepts
Guest speakers
Teacher directed learning activities
Exam-like testing conditions
Time for meaningful research simulations
Cooperative learning
Role playing
