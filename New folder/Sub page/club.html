	<p><br>Vianney offers a variety of co-curricular clubs and activities. If a student can’t find an activity that meets his interests, he is welcome to develop a club, recruit members and seek a faculty member to sponsor the group’s activities. There is always a way for every student to get involved at Vianney.</p>
